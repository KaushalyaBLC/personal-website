            <h2>Parking Management Application</h2>

            <p>The Parking Management Application is a command-line utility designed to streamline vehicle entry and
                exit management in parking lots. As a software solution, it simplifies the process of recording vehicle
                details when entering the parking lot, tracks entry time, and calculates parking fees based on the
                duration of stay and vehicle type.</p>

            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>User-friendly interface: The application provides a simple and intuitive command-line interface for
                    easy interaction.</li>

                <li>Efficient fee calculation: The utility accurately calculates parking fees for vehicles based on
                    their type and duration of stay.</li>

                <li>Data integrity: The application ensures data integrity and efficient management of parking records.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Use:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Enter Vehicle Details: Users can log vehicle entry by providing the vehicle number and selecting the
                    vehicle type (Car or Motorcycle).</li>

                <li>Exit and Fee Calculation: When a vehicle exits the parking lot, the user enters the vehicle number.
                    The application calculates the parking fee and displays the total fee.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Future Enhancements:</h3>

            <p>The application is open to future enhancements, including support for additional vehicle types, graphical
                user interface (GUI) implementation, and advanced features such as parking reservations and online
                payment options.</p>

            <h3>Technology Used:</h3>

            <p>The Parking Management Application is developed using the C programming language with minimal hardware
                and software requirements, making it a lightweight and efficient solution.</p>
