            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello there! I'm delighted to have you here. My name is Chamath Kaushalya, and I am a computer science
                undergraduate studying at the University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka. I am passionate about
                programming and have a deep fascination for the world of technology. I find joy in exploring new
                concepts and applying them to create innovative solutions.</p>
            <h2>Education and Background</h2>
            <p>I completed my A-Level and O-Level examinations at Ananda College in Colombo 10, Sri Lanka. Ananda
                College is a renowned educational institution known for its commitment to academic excellence. During my
                time there, I had the honor of being a member of the School Science Union, where I actively participated
                in organizing Science Day and the All Island School Science Quiz Competition. These experiences not only
                fostered my love for science and technology but also developed my skills in teamwork and leadership.</p>
            <h2>Passion for Programming</h2>
            <p>I have always been captivated by the power of programming. The ability to transform ideas into functional
                and efficient code is incredibly fulfilling for me. Throughout my computer science studies at the
                University of Kelaniya, I am proficient in various programming languages and enjoy exploring new
                frameworks and technologies to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>
            <h2>Portfolio Highlights</h2>
            <p>I invite you to explore my portfolio, where I showcase projects that demonstrate my passion and skills in
                programming. From web development to software applications, each project represents my dedication to
                crafting practical and impactful solutions.
            </p>
            <h2>Collaboration and Growth</h2>
            <p>I firmly believe that collaboration is key to success. I enjoy working in teams, leveraging the
                collective intelligence and diverse perspectives to create innovative solutions. My experience in
                working in the Science Union at Ananda College has nurtured
                my ability to work collaboratively and effectively communicate ideas. I am always open to new
                opportunities that allow me to collaborate with like-minded individuals and contribute to exciting
                projects.</p>
